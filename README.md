# rock-paper-scissors-game
Another fun project complete! I whipped this one up in a jiffy. 

In this project I demonstrated my use of basic JavaScript (erm, dont u mean ECMAScript???) including: conditionals, variables, operators, functions, and basic debugging. Personally, I can't wait to learn how to cycle through multiple options without using if/else and switch statements. I think it would be fun to write code so that the CPU has a little more strategy, but that is beyond the scope of the current project. Ta-ta for now! ^_^
